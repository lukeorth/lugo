      <title>Battleship Solver</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently stumbled across &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/december32011/&#34;&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; by Nick Berry and really enjoyed it.  If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in data science, math, or board games, I highly recommend his &lt;a href=&#34;https://datagenetics.com/blog.html&#34;&gt;DataGenetics blog&lt;/a&gt;.  It&amp;rsquo;s a treasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this particular post, Nick compares strategies for &lt;em&gt;Battleship&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ndash; the classic board game you probably played as a kid.  Naturally, the most effective approach mimics how we intuitively play the game ourselves (more on that later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick does a terrific job explaining the algorithm, but I wanted a way to visualize it.  To that end, I created &lt;a href=&#34;https://battleship.lukeorth.com&#34;&gt;this web app&lt;/a&gt; so that others can enjoy it too.  If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in learning more about the algorithm and its implementation in code, read on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have much to say in this post.  I&amp;rsquo;ve had this blog for several months and haven&amp;rsquo;t written a word.  This is my attempt to break that streak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newton said that an object in motion will stay in motion unless acted upon by an outside force.  So, assuming I&amp;rsquo;m not homogenized with the asphalt anytime soon, I&amp;rsquo;ll be writing some more (I think).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned.  üèÉüöå&lt;/p&gt;</description>
