Want to add comments to your site without introducing trackers and bloat?  If so, [Remark42](https://remark42.com/) may be for you.  It's a commenting engine that is lightweight, functional, and easy to configure using Docker.  In this post, I'll show you how to set it up.

## Is Remark42 for you?

As the title suggests, Remark42 is a *self-hosted* solution -- meaning *you* provide the infrastructure.  

Remark42's greatest strength is that it's self-hosted.  Sure, other commenting engines like [Disqus]() and [Facebook Comments]() are popular because they are free and easy to use.

## Installation

To start, I recommend opening the Remark42 [docs](https://remark42.com/docs/getting-started/installation/) to reference as needed.
